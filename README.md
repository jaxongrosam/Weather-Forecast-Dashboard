# Weather-Forecast-Dashboard

## Description

I could not finish this as I have been under the weather, but will come back to it. The Weather Dashboard was created to easily be able to see weather information about a specific city. Whether you're planning on traveling there or just checking out homebase, it's a convenient and quick way to do so. Even incomplete, it's helped me solidify my understanding of pulling things from APIs, and how to log that information.
